# Micro Interactions Dojo

I have learned CSS and Design Methodologies through the development of [CSS tricks](https://github.com/BcRikko/css-collection) and [NES.css](https://github.com/nostalgic-css/NES.css). 

However, I don't have much skills in CSS animation.

This repository is created to learn CSS animation and to train myself to implement even the most challenging UI designs presented by designers.
